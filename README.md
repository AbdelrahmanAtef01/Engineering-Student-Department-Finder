# ðŸŽ“ Expert System for Engineering Department Recommendation

An AI-based expert system built using **Prolog** and a **Python GUI**, designed to help engineering students in their preparatory year explore which department best matches their skills, traits, and academic performance.  

---

## Overview
Choosing the right engineering department can be tough for preparatory-year students.  
This project provides a simple interactive tool where students can:  

- Enter their **grades** in preparatory subjects  
- Rate their **skills** and **personal traits**  
- Get a **matching percentage** with each engineering department  

The system then suggests which department might be the best fit, based on logic rules and preferences.

## Tech Stack
- **Prolog** â†’ Core expert system & reasoning engine  
- **Python (PyQt)** â†’ Graphical User Interface  
- **AI Concepts** â†’ Rule-based reasoning, knowledge representation

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
The results werenâ€™t about cutting-edge AI, but about showing how even simple tools can guide students in making important choices, how even the early AI stages were helpful, and where all the tech that we're learning right now started.
